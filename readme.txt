== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What do I type under "Title"? =
"Title" refers to your widget's heading. If you fill in "My Recent Tweets", it will show up as "My Recent Tweets" for your title of the sidebar widget above your tweets.

= What do I type under "Your Twitter Username"? =
You need to add in your Twitter username here. This plugin will then automatically pull out your most recent tweets straight from the Twitter feed.

The recommended size is 5 tweets, but you can choose as many as you like if you have a long blog page. We've added display for up to 20 tweets, due to popular demand.

If you choose Yes, the link (Follow@yourtwitterid) will appear under your tweets. This will make it more convenient for people to follow you on Twitter with just one click.
